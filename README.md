### How it works

When clicked, a pop-up should appear, click the "Group Analysis button while
in a group members page".
It will automatically scroll the page and collect the data from all the
members.

If you have to stop the group analysis in the middle there is no problem, you
can analyze the same group again and at the end of the analysis all duplicates
are automatically removed.

When you have collected the data from some members you can then click "Members
Analysis" and a new tab will open, and get the information from each member
page automatically.

When you have enough data you can click "download data" and a CSV file with
all the data will be downloaded, you can open the file with excel or in google
sheets.
