My end-goal is to build prospecting lists from FB groups for my marketing agency.

For this project, I want to be able to install a chrome extension that when run on the page of a private/closed FB group member page (like this one: https://www.facebook.com/groups/B2BSaaSColdOutreachMastery/members) will scrape the member information into a google spreadsheet.

Alternatively, it can be an add-on from the google sheet app that I launch, select my FB account, and then select the group from a dropdown.


Review the spreadsheet here of the exact steps I want to take to use the extension or add-on and what I want it to do:

Since the work isn't scoped perfectly, or that I might need changes after using it, I'm looking for an hourly engagement for this project that starts at 5-10 hours/week.
